Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. Software engineering places a crucial role in the technological industries by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power different aspects within modern life including communication, commerce, healthcare, and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
*The development of programming languages - the first known programming language was created in 1886. The eveolution of programming languages is a testament to the relentless pursuit of more efficient and powerful ways to communicate with machines. As technology advances so will tthe langues used to harness it's potential.
*The establishment of software engineering as a discipline - establishing software engineering as a discipline has lead to and can lead to higher quality software that are more reliable, predictable, and maintainable, as well as increaded productivity and better cost management.
*The arrival of structured programming - this means that the code will execute the instruction by instruction one after the other. This approach makes the code easier to read, user friendly, easier to maintain, and easier to debug.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and sytem requirements.
Design - creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - writing and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - conducting different tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Agile enables teams to respond quickly and adaptively to changes during the development process, whereas Waterfall is less flexible and resistant to changes once the project's scope has been defined.
Waterfall will be appropriate in well defined projects with clearly specified requirements, limited complexity, and a definitive timeline. Waterfall works well when the customer's demands are straight to the point and there are no big changes in scope or technology during the project.
Agile will be appropriate in a case where the end goal may be unclear or difficult to define, when the complex systems require constant feedback, or when timelines and budgetsa re tight. Agile is also effective for developing software applications since it allows for quick iteration and testing along the way.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer - ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager - oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are important in the software development process because they provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing the code. Example is Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are important as they provide software tools for tracking changes to source code and coodinating work among team members. Example is Git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - change during development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays
How to overcome:
1. Implement Agile methodologies like Scrum or Kanban to adapt to changing requirements more efficiently.
2. Encourage effective communication to avaoid misunderstanding and resolve issues.
3. Prioritize requirements to manage scope and changes.

Tight deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule
How to overcome:
1. Prioritize tasks by breaking down the project into smaller parts and identify critical features or components
2. effective time management by prioritizing tasks and streamline processess
3. communicating clearly with the development team is essential

Technical debt
How to overcome:
1. Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential technical debt early in development
2. implement automated testing practices to detect bugs promptly
3. continuosly refactor code to improve quality and reduce debt
4. document technical debt and prioritize it based on impact.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - important for testing individual components or modules of software
Integration - important for testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System - important for testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance - important for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering means promting(requesting) a generative AI tool to perform a task, it is a technique for guiding and improving the responses generated by AI models.
Prompting engineering gives developers more control over user's interactions with AI. They help the AI refine the output and present it concisely in the rewired formst.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"How to take care of a dog?"
"How to take care of a german shephard?"
The prompt improved because of the second prompt was more direct and specific into what i want to know and find out.
